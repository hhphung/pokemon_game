Project Title: Pokemon Battles
Project Description: A program that helps me engage battle pokemons between the trainers or a wild pokemon. I started with adding more stuff into my classes, more functions or variables that needed. Then I created an extra pokemon class to store the values from the last assignment. Then I implemented the engaging battle. Given two different types of battle, I implemented the battles of trainers and wild pokemon similarly. In battles, I started with showing the pokemon method, from which the players can pick the pokemon. Then I implemented the fight, based on the pick move, and formula of the damage,I use the arrow ^ and v to show the direction of the damage, I successfully finished the battles. Then bag methods, where the players can heal and revive their pokemon. Last thing was quitting the battles. I ran into some bugs with picking pokemons, or picking the moves, but after a couple experiments, I figured things out.
